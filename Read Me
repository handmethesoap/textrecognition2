In order to operate this text detection code the parameters in parameters.par must be set and palced in the same folder as the executible.

A path to training data for the dictionary generation must be provided as well as to the training data for the text recognition and to test data.

A dictionary must either be already generated or be generated when running the program. The folder in which the dictionary is to be read
from or saved to as well as the flag controlling generation are set in parameters.par.

Train data must also be either generated or read and the save or read location as well as generate flag is set in parameters.par

The dictionary size, numbers of images to process and window sizes to use when searching for text are also all set in parameters.par
